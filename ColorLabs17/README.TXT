Trial 1: I started by creating four equal buckets. I think there is too much blue in the picture, and the faces could use more
definition. I also think there should be more white, and the dark blue should be a green. 

Trial 2: I like the definition on the face, but I think there is too much green on my face. I will make the green bucket smaller.

Trial 3: I changed my mind about the light green - I want to change it back into a darker color. I also want to add another color
to add more definition to the faces
