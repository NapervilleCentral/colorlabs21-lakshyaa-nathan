Trial 1: I started by creating four equal buckets. The faces could use more
definition. I also think there should be more white. There might need to be more contrast between the colors, as all the colors are light. 

Trial 2: I like the definition on the face, but I think there is too much green on my face. I will make the green bucket smaller and change the 
green to a dark blue. This will also add even more definition to the faces. 

Trial 3: I want to add two other colors to add some more depth to the whole picture. I think that this color should be red and light green, as it will stand out in the picture.
